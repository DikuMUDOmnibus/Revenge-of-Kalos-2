-1 ALIENS~
#2#uThe Story#n#2
The Second Intergalactic War left billions dead and
billions more injured. The forces of Terra Prime
had finally defeated the alien menace... Or so they
thought. Little did they know that a few of the hid-
eous aliens remained alive, drifting through space
in ships too damaged to be repaired. At the mercy
of time, most of the remaining aliens died from st-
arvation or simply old age. A few of the more crafty
aliens realized they could be floating through
space for aeons before they came across a habitable
planet, so they went into cryo-stasis.

#u10 Years later#n#2
It was a warm night in the kingdom of Kalos. A hot
breeze was blowing, and dark clouds hung low over
the lands. Nobody was able to sleep, so everyone
saw what appeared to be a great fiery mountain fall
from the sky. A few of the braver souls went to take
a look at it from close, but only one came back,
and he was heavily wounded... He said only one thing
before he expired: "The aliens have arrived..."#n
They were called the Ambro.

0 JOG~
Syntax: jog <direction list>

The <direction list> consists of a string of directions in the
form <#d>.  "#" is optional and represents the number of times
to repeat the direction.  "d" is the direction you wish to jog.
You may also use <od> in the direction list where "o" stands for
open and "d" is the direction of the door you wish to open.

  Example:  jog 12eos3ses4w

This command is used for speedwalking from one place to another.
Once you start jogging, no other commands will be processed
until you stop.  There are only a few conditions that will
stop you from jogging.

  1.  You reach your destination.
  2.  You are unable to move to the next room.

As far as the mud is concerned, all directions processed while
jogging are received as if they were entered one at a time.
This means that anything that can happen during normal walking
can also happen while jogging.  All rooms are shown in brief
mode while jogging.

0 TAG~
#2  Sometimes life in the world can get a bit stressfull, so we all need
to relax and play games from time to time.  One way you can do this is 
by starting up a game of tag ammongst your fellow players.  The rules 
are simple!
  
  To start a game of tag, you must first Tag someone (Using TAG <Player>) 
If no one is nearby or willing to be 'IT' first, you can tag yourself.  
The idea is then for players to run arround the world trying to avoid 
being caught by the person who is 'IT', Only one person can be 'IT' at 
any one time, and when they catch someone their 'IT' status is removed 
and the player they tag becomes 'IT'.
  
  Whenever the state of play changes, eg if someone tags someone else, 
starts a game, or ends a game players are informed via the info channel.
  
  Commands are as follows...
  
  TAG <Player>	- Start a game, or tag the next person if you are already IT
  TAG show	- Shows wether a game is in progress, and if so displays who 
		  is currently IT
  TAG quit	- Used to end a game of tag, can only be issued by the 
		  player who is IT#n

2 POLICY~

* Cloning of Artifacts is banned! And always has been.

  Cloning of ANY artifact will result in all copies of the cloned artifact
  being removed from the game and any further action deemed appropriate by
  myself or the God(s) concerned.

* Multiplaying is banned!

  Anyone caught multiplaying will have ALL of the concerned characters deleted
  or any lesser penalty deemed appropriate by the immortal dealing with it.

* No spamming any channels

  This is unfriendly and upsets people. The penalty for this is that the 
  offending player will be silenced for a period determined by the immortal.

* No purposeful crashing of the mud.

  Deliberate crashing of the mud will cause you to be denied or possibly
  deleted and may even end up in your site being prevented from connecting
  to the mud (banned). 

* Sharing characters

  This is frowned upon heavily.

* Storage of Artifacts 

  You are not allowed to place your artifact(s) on a "storage character"
  Any storage characters found will be deleted and the artifact(s) they
  were storing will be placed back in the game at the immortals discression.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>
Syntax: call <object>
Syntax: call all
Syntax: gift <object> <player>
Syntax: locate

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.
~



0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce (represented by 1000exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even eat their head ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.
~



0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.
~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~



0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when 
mortally wounded.  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move 
to 0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless 
at recall...so be careful how you use it.
~



0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~



0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~



0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~



0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~



0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~



0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your alignment versus your opponent's alignment; how 
many of this monster have been killed lately (if they are an NPC); and 
some random variation.

See also help on 'status'.
~



0 STATUS~

This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of 
how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

     0  = Avatar
 1 - 4  = Immortal
 5 - 9  = Godling
10 - 14 = Demigod
15 - 19 = Lesser God
20 - 24 = Greater God
25 +    = Supreme God

Remember, if your status is Immortal or above you gain nothing for 
decapitating an Avatar (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).
~



0 SKILL~
Syntax: skill | skill <player>

This shows the target player's skill with the weapon they are currently 
wielding and the stance they are in (if it's a specialized stance).

Weapon skill				 Stance skill

 1) Totally unskilled.			 1) Totally unskilled.
 2) Slightly skilled.			 2) An apprentice.
 3) Reasonable.				 3) A trainee.
 4) Fairly competent.			 4) A student.
 5) Highly skilled.			 5) Fairly experienced.
 6) Very dangerous.			 6) Well trained.
 7) Extremely deadly.			 7) Highly skilled.
 8) An expert.				 8) An expert.
 9) A master.				 9) A master.
10) A grandmaster.			10) A grandmaster.

Note that these are only rough estimates; one master might well be 
slightly more skilled than another master, and so on.
~



0 SPELL SPELLS~
Syntax: spells | spell <colour>

This shows your spell casting ability with the various types of magic.

1) Untrained.				 6) An adept.
2) An apprentice.			 7) A mage.
3) A student.				 8) A warlock.
4) A scholar.				 9) A master wizard.
5) A magus.				10) A grand sorcerer.

Note that these are only rough estimates; one master wizard might well be 
slightly more skilled than another master wizard, and so on.
~



0 GODLESS~
By typing this, you will no longer be affected by most god commands, 
including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze, etc.  You 
can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.
~



0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~



0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not 
accumulate; use them or lost them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse 
of pets.
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~



0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~

FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 ANSI COLOUR~
Syntax: ansi

This will show things in colour.  Spells will appear in their appropriate 
colour, and important messages will be highlighted.  Your exp (or opponents
condition if you're fighting), hp, mana and move are shown in scaled colour.
Scaled colour is represented as follows:

Cyan   : Maximum.
Yellow : 75% to just below maximum.
Green  : 50% to just below 75%
Blue   : 25% to just below 50%
Red    : Below 25%

Ansi colour can be toggled on and off with the 'ansi' or 'config' commands.
~

0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

See also help on 'advancedstance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 STANCETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough 
estimates, and may not be completely accurate...

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' BOARD 'NOTE SYSTEM' BOARDS~
Syntax:

board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
note                                    Reads next note.
note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note write                              Posts a note.
note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved 
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).
~

0 CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

0 PROMPT CPROMPT~

This command allows you to configure your prompt.  The PROMPT command 
will set your standard prompt.  You also have the option of having a 
combat prompt, CPROMPT, which will appear while fighting.  If no cprompt 
is defined, the standard prompt will be used for both conditions.

your customised prompts.
~

0 PRIMAL~

Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
primal energy is only one use, and is generally used for very powerful 
spells, such as 'voodoo' (which uses 5 points) and 'quest' (which uses 
between 1 and 50 points).
~

0 WEREWOLF WEREWOLVES~

At the beginning of things, Gaia - the world and the spirit that embodies 
it - set all things in a balance that would maintain and encourage life.  
Near the top of this chain of being was humanity, and above them were the 
Garou - the sacred warriors of the spirit.  They were appointed to be the 
crusaders against the Wyrm, who spreads its cancer through the humans.  
They are the preservers of the raw essence of life, of nature's diversity 
and purity.  They are the Earth's immune system, fighting the disease of 
the Wyrm.  They are the werewolves, and they fight and destroy the 
children of the Wyrm (such as the vampires) at every opportunity.

* Claw - Transforms target into a werewolf, but costs 10000 exp. 
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your werewolf lineage.
* Howl - A special channel that only werewolves can understand.
* Tribe - Shows information on other werewolves logged on.
* Totem - Lists the current totem powers you have at your control.

In addition, all werewolves can gain totem powers, which grant additional 
powers.  For more information, type 'help totems'.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~

Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed 
to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for 
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will 
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store 
some blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, 
none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat 
immunity take normal fire damage rather than double.  Other abilities:

* Fangs - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.
* Bite - Transforms target into a vampire, but costs the vampire 1000 exp.
* Order - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
* Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
* Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.
* Vclan - Shows information on the other members of a vampires clan.
* Feed - For feeding other vampires with your blood.
* Favour - Make a vampire a Prince, allow them to sire a childe, accepts 
  or inducts them into the clan, or outcasts them from the clan.

In addition, all vampires get 3 or more disciplines, each of which grant 
one or more extra powers.  For more information type 'help disciplines'.
The VAMPIRE command toggles on/off whether vampires may bite/feed you.
~

0 MAGE MAGES~

Mages are those who study the greatest of magicks.  Their spells are far 
greater than those of a non-mage, as well as far more flexible.  Some of 
the main features of mages are as follows:

* Extra spells - Extra spells unavailable to non-mages, including spells 
  such as 'find familiar', 'polymorph', 'major creation', etc.
* Rune spells - Combinations of runes allow the mage to construct new spells.
* Advanced spells - Available to the more powerful of mages, this ability 
  allows the mage to create their own spells from scratch.  Such a task is 
  very difficult as well as time consuming, however.
* Memorise - Allows the mage to memorise a spell from their spellbook.
* Introduce - Allows the mage to list his/her master, master's master, etc.
* Teach - Allows the mage to make an apprentice.

Please note that mages are still under play testing, and are not yet 
fully working.
~

0 DEMON DEMONS CHAMPION CHAMPIONS~

These fiends are the damned ones.  They have sold their souls in exchange 
for power, and they improve this power by draining the souls of their 
victims.  Their powers are mysterious, but the following facts are known:

* Each Champion, Demon, or Demon Prince follows a specific Demon Lord.  
  They are able to channel the souls of their victims to their Demon Lord, 
  who in turn can use that power to grant favours to his/her followers.
* Demonic armour improves the combat ability of the wearer, the more 
  armour worn the better the improvement.
* Many demons are able to transport themselves to each other at will.
* Most demons are able to assume the form of a weapon.
* The demons power over death is such that even after they have been 
  decapitated, they are still able to employ a selection of powers.
* The powers of a specific demon vary considerably.  Some are barely more 
  powerful than a common avatar, while others are as strong as the greatest 
  of werewolves or vampires.
* While in hell, a demon is virtually unkillable.
~

0 BEAST~

Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

SIRE allows the target vampire of your clan to sire another vampire.  
Once a single vampire has been created the power is lost, but can be 
granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.  A childe sired 
without permission is known as an Anarch.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

ACCEPT will accept a childe into the clan, making them a Neonate.

INDUCT and OUTCAST will accept an Anarch into the clan or outcast a member.
~

0 TOTEM TOTEMS~

Every werewolf is able to learn special totem powers from various 
spirits.  Each of the spirits teaches a different type of power, and the 
werewolf is able to gain use of these powers through the expenditure of 
primal energy.

The following totem animals exist.

* Bear   - Flex, Rage, Steel Claws, Hibernate.
* Boar   - Shatter, Charge, Toughness, Immovability.
* Lynx   - Light Footed, Stalker, Combat Speed, Lightning Claws.
* Owl    - Vanish, Shield, Shadowplane, Channel.
* Spider - Poisonous Bite, Web, Poison Immunity.
* Wolf   - Claws, Fangs, Calm, Spirit of Fernis.
* Hawk   - Nightsight, Shadowsight, Truesight.
* Mantis - Agility, Intuition, Speed of the Fenris, Dance of Fernis.
~

0 DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINES~

Each vampire has three clan disciplines from which their powers come.  In 
addition to these basic three, vampires are allowed to select additional 
disciplines by spending primal; the first extra discipline costs 10, the 
second costs 20, and so on.  Only the three clan disciplines are passed 
on to later generations.

There are nine disciplines, each with the following powers:

* Protean       - Nightsight, Claws, Change.
* Celerity      - An extra attack, Reduced move cost for spells.
* Fortitude     - Improved hitpoints, Damage resistance.
* Potence       - Improved damage.
* Obfuscate     - Mask, Mortal, Shield.
* Obtenebration - Shadowplane, Shadowsight, Nightsight.
* Serpentis     - Darkheart, Serpent, Poison.
* Auspex        - Truesight, Scry, Readaura.
* Dominate      - Command, Shield, Ghoul.

For more information, type 'help <discipline name>'.
~

0 PROTEAN~

This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

The powers available to this Discipline are as follows:
* Nightsight: Gives the vampire full night vision, which is much better 
than normal infravision.
* Claws: Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
* Change: Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
attack each other.
~

0 CELERITY~

This Discipline explains the legendary superior quickness of vampires.  
Using the Celerity Discipline allows a vampire to move extremely quickly 
and have extra attacks in the same round.
~

0 FORTITUDE~

Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping 
the weapons from harming them at all.
~

0 POTENCE~

This Discipline defines the superior strength that vampires often 
possess.  This physical might allows the user to inflict much larger 
amounts of damage in combat than normal.
~

0 OBFUSCATE~

Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

Kindred with this power gain the following advantages:
* Mask: Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
* Shield: Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
* Mortal: Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
  form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are 
  undetectable from a normal mortal.
~

0 OBTENEBRATION~

Obtenebration allows the user to manipulate the powers of darkness.  By 
using their powers they are able to switch between the normal world and 
the plane of shadows at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.
~

0 SERPENTIS~

Serpentis is the art of temptation and corruption.  Vampires with this 
Discipline have the ability to tear out their own hearts, rendering 
themselves immune to being staked.  Serpentis users also gain the ability 
to transform themselves into a giant serpent and back at will.  The third 
ability available to vampires with this Discipline is the ability to run 
their tongues along weapons, coating them with a deadly snake venom.
~

0 AUSPEX~

This Discipline is one of extrasensory awareness, empathy and 
perception.  Those using this Discipline tend to be strongly affected by 
environmental phenomena.  Vampires with Auspex are able to see and sense 
things most other people cannot.  Auspex is the opposing Discipline to 
Obfuscate, and they cancel out many of each others powers.

This Discipline allows the following powers:
* Truesight: The user can see everything, whether invisible or whatever.
* Scry: Allows you to view the room that the specified target is in.
* Readaura: Gives you detailed information about a creature or object.
~

0 DOMINATE~

This discipline reflects the mystical ability of vampires to influence 
the minds and actions of others.  Dominate is an aspect of the power of 
the mind and the will.

This Discipline allows the following powers:
* Evileye: The user gains a lot of control over people foolish enough to 
  look at them.  Not yet fully working.
* Command: The user can issue a command that the target will be compelled 
  to obey.  This will only work on those who's minds are much weaker than 
  the vampire's.
* Shield: Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
* Ghoul: By feeding a mob some of his/her blood, the vampire can create a 
  ghoul - a loyal servant to act as their eyes and ears.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have
