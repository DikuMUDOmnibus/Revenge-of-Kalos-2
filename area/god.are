The Chat Room~
You are lounging in a quiet cosy parlour, warmed by a gentle magical fire
which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  There are no doors out.  Clearly
the owner of this room needs none.

The God's Lounge~
You are in a large room with many chairs and footrests, some fabric, some
leather.  A fireplace burns brightly here, and you feel at peace.  There are 
no doors leading to or from this mystical place.

Da Fuzzy One, High Lord of (HEMP) Outdoors Indoors~
It is hard to tell if you just stepped outdoors or you are still
inside. This room rests against an enormous redwood tree, which forms the 
inner wall.  Some lower branches reach out across the room towards the
sunlight which streams through the glass ceiling.  Large Wratton basket
chairs filled with enormous soft cushions swing from the tree's branches. 
During the heat of the day, or when da Wolf seeks night, the glass
ceiling darkens until the room has the comfort of a shaded spot in deep
forest or a cave buried in the face of a mountain.  The roof slants
gradually from its peak 20 feet up the side of the tree to a bare 8
inches from the thick dark green moss which cushions the floor.  A very
fine screen forms the short remaining wall.  The mesh seems to disappear
when you attempt to look closely at it.  A bubbling stream fills the pond 
at the center of the room, and the force of the water forms a small
fountain.
