The Black Spiral Dancers Meeting Room~
You are in the middle of headquarters of the EVIL Black Spiral
Dancers.  You sense nothing but the aura of pure EVIL that
illuminates from the walls, the floor, and from every exit of
the room.  You try to escape the feeling but the power overwhelms
you.  You sense the evil.. You LIKE the evil.. You become the evil.

The Black Spiral Dancers Portal Room~
Magic enshrounds this room as well as blurry images that faze in
and out of lands that you have seen before.  The knowledge of how
to use these portals is only possessed by those who are deserving
of it.  Unless you are deserving .. by the time you read this
room description.. you should be dead.
